### Updates to Create Project Page

### Added toggle to remove header from Try It Now dashboards. 
Adding the ```showTitle``` flag to the Try It Now url will disable the header. 
eg.
```
https://start.cortanaintelligence.com/TryItNow/Dashboard/campaignmanagement?showTitle=false
```

### Pattern Publish Disable
We have temporarily disabled the publish feature on production due to issues with:
- Handling stale gallery loads
- High gallery load latencies. 

We apologize for the inconvenience. Please contact [caqseng@microsoft.com](mailto:caqseng@microsoft.com) if you wish to publish your templates. 
If you need to share your templates with other users, please use the “Share” feature.

### ODBC validation for Credential tag
We now adhere to the ODBC 3.0 spec for credential validation. [Refer here for details](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-CortanaIntelligence-SolutionAuthoringWorkspace/blob/master/docs/solution-authoring.md#credential).
