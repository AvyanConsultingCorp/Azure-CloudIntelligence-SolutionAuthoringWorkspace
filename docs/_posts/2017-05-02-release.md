### Making deployments of shared solutions trackable
Previously, privately shared solutions could not be easily identified and attributed to specific authors. They appeared in our logs and metrics as <solution>@user and were indistinguishable from test deployments done by solution authors themselves.
With this change, solution IDs associated with deployments of private solutions will be in the format of <solution>@<unique_share_id>. For example:

```xml
mysolution@share13f93a6bee754433b223685f6197add7
```

Besides allowing us to effortlessly track the usage of the “share” feature, this will also enable us to build comprehensive reporting for authors (particularly, ISVs) who privately share solutions with their customers.

### Bug fixes
- Users without validate Azure subscription will be redirected to a mitigation pages seamlessly in CIQS
- Solution template fixes

### Framework improvements
- Onboarded to MDM (Geneva Hotpath monitoring/alerting), and emit Hearbeat metric of CIQS
