### Deployment engine stability improvements

Introducing synchronization into the CIQS provisioning engine to guarantee a single execution of each deployment activity.

This solves the issue of multiple post-deployment notification emails occasionally sent to the user.

### Early resource group creation and improved error handling

Resource groups are now created at the same time as the deployment itself. This allows catching and reporting such resource group creation issues as:
- use of registered trademarks in the resource group's name
- name conflicts with existing resource groups in the same subscription
- having insufficient permissions to create resource groups

In all such scenarios, the user will be shown an actionable error message and allowed to correct the error and continue.

### Allowing reuse of empty resource groups

If a resource group already exists, but is empty, CIQS will simply reuse it when a new deployment with the same name is created.

### Bug fixes in several solutions

* Collecting user input up-front in *Telco Customer Churn and Real-time Analytics*
* VM name validation in *Windows Data Science VM*
