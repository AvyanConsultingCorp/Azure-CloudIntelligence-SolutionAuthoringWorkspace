# Getting started

Let's get this straight: we really strive to help you be as efficient as possible when building Solutions. That was and still remains the primary goal of the *Solution Authoring Workspace* (aka *SAW*).

## Wait! What *exactly* is *SAW*?

Good question!

*Solution Authoring Workspace* (SAW) has three ingredients:

- Documentation
  <br>You are reading it now. It will be getting better. We promise.
  
- [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-CortanaIntelligence-SolutionAuthoringWorkspace/tree/master/Samples)
  <br>They are simple and immediately deployable. Samples can serve as building blocks for the real stuff you have in mind.
  
- Tools
  <br>We got some tools to help you build new Solutions and get them into CIQS for testing, sharing and publishing. (Not sure what CIQS is? Check [this]({{ site.baseurl }}) out!)
  

## In-browser solution development (any OS)

## Local development (Windows)
### One-time setup for Chrome and Firefox
