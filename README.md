# Cortana Intelligence Solution Authoring Workspace (SAW)

This repository contains a community-driven and constantly expanding collection of samples and resources that help shape ideas into ready-to-deploy customizable solutions powered by *Azure* and *Cortana Intelligence Services*.

*SAW* was built as a development tool to complement the *Cortana Intelligence Solutions* (aka *CIQS*) platform by streamlining the authoring process from the conception of an idea and initial prototyping, to the shipping of a finished product to the end customer.

Please refer to [our documentation](https://azure.github.io/Azure-CortanaIntelligence-SolutionAuthoringWorkspace/) to get started.
