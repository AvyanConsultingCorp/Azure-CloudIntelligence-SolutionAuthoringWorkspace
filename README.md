# Cortana Intelligence Solution Authoring Workspace (SAW)

This repository contains a community-driven and constantly expanding collection of tools and resources that help shape ideas into ready-to-deploy customizable solutions powered by *Azure* and *Cortana Intelligence Services*.

*SAW* was built as a development tool to complement the *Cortana Intelligence Solutions* (aka *CIQS*) platform by streamlining the authoring process from the conception of an idea and initial prototyping, to the shipping of a finished product to the end customer.

* Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
  * Authoring documentation: solution package format, supported features, guidelines and examples
  * Debugging and troubleshooting manual
  * Authoring bootcamp: a set of tutorials on building, testing and publishing new solutions
* Command-line tools
  * Build solution assets from source code
  * Verify solution package and artifacts
  * Test and debug solution provisioning workflow
  * Deploy solutions into *CIQS* for further testing, sharing and publishing
